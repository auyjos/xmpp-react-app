- **Version Control:** Git

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (v6 or higher)
- **Git** (for version control)

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xmpp-chat-app.git
   cd xmpp-chat-app
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   cd chat
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the frontend server:**
   ```bash
   npm run start

   The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3001` (or a different port if configured).

## Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3001`.
